            This was one of my more simpler CFU's but it was something that made me really proud because I tried my best to create a cute looking cat that was somewhat accurate to my teachers example! In this project I created a character in the shape of a cat only using a single line instead of multiple lines of code. Come check it out and say hi to catty!

            Help out a little canadian kid by having a fun interactive way to calculate how much money you have in canadian money! This was a little bit more
            on the challenging side and I could try and improve it to make it better, but for the project itself I think it was very creative and well done. It was
            actually one of my favorites because it was different from what we would usually do.

            This is a four part code that is interactive with the user, it asks multiple questions that the user will type in and go back and forth with the computer. This was a fun code because 
            whatever answer the user printed it will be responded with the answer the computer is programmed to say which I thought was really cool.So if you are curious of what it asks you, come answer some short easy questions!

            Do you know the 99 bottles song? Well this is the code just for you. 
            It is a bit on the lengthier side to read because it is the entire song! I used for loops and print to be 
            able to create the song where it would go from 99 to 0 which was able to happen because of the for loop. Therefore I think 
            you should check this code out and sing along to the lines of code that will appear when you click run. Have fun!
